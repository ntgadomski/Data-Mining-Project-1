# Data-Mining-Project-1
Knowledge Disc. & Data Mining
Course number: CAP 4770

This project was reading and manipulating a CSV file to implement further data mining algorithms.
The CSV provided by the class was about rotten tomato reviews from customers.
The program itself utilizes a pandas reader and dataframe while also splitting the words into a bag of words
with the naive bayes algorithm provided by sklearn. The accuracy of the training set is recorded in the output window.
Once everything was implemented, our group then graphed the bag of words into highest frequency of occurence. 
The frequencies graphed were Uni-grams, Bi-grams, and Tri-grams from the provided CSV file.

-Below is the program executing and giving the proper output
